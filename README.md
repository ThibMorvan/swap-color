# swap-color

Swap Color is a tiny video game made by Thibault Morvan, programming student.
It is a clone of "Flood It", upgraded with multiplayer.

The project is written in Object Oriented Java, please feel free to comment if you find anything gross in the code.
I will welcome critics and avises with open arms !
